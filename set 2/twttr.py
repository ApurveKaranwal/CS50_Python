#When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or
#  space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called 
# twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for
#  a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, 
# whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
