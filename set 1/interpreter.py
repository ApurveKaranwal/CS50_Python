#In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic
#  expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to
#  one decimal place. Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space
#  between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:
#x is an integer
#y is +, -, *, or /
#z is an integer
